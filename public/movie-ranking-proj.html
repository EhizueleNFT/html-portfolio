<h1>The Best Movies According To Ehizzy</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr>
<h3>The Expendables Sequel</h3>
<p>This Action-packed blockbuster gave Ehizzy everything He wanted in a movie.From action, to comedy, to thriller... it was complete!!</p>
<h3>Puss In Boots: The Last Wish</h3>
<p>This should be number 1 by Ehizzy's standard. Dreamworks really do know how to make that Dream work! It was everything Ehizzy wanted in an animation and more!</p>
<h3>The Forbidden Kingdom</h3>
<p>It is safe for anyone to guess Ehizzy is a hard fan for action movies. The synchronicity between Jet Li and Jackie Chan in this movie was a sight to behold. A timeless movie to say the least!! </p>
